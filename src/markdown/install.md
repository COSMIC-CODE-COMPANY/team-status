## Basic installation

Just click the Install button to get started.

## Create a custom status list

Once the application is installed, you'll be prompted to configure a custom Status list. The app comes preconfigured with popular status options.

_NOTE_

- Separate each status option with a comma (eg: phone, email, chat). You can even use emojis (we love emojis!). It's recommended to keep each status option short and clear to help with the user experience. Long status options may get truncated in the UI.

- When the app is initially installed, all agents will be set to a status of "unknown". This will be updated once agents set their status for the first time.

## Customize "Active" color

When you have 1 or more agents in any particular status, we treat that status as "active", meaning people are currently working (or playing) on that task.

You can modify the active color using any of Zendesk's theme colors (https://zendeskgarden.github.io/css-components/utilities/color/). The possible options are:

- grey
- blue
- kale
- read
- green
- yellow
- fuschia
- pink
- crimson
- orange
- lemon
- lime
- mint
- teal
- azure
- royal
- purple

Just type the color in the "Active_Color" box on the app settings screen.

_NOTES_

- The app will default to "blue" if an invalid option is supplied or no option is supplied.
- "Offline" is a special status that will never show in the Active color
