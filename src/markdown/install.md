Just click the Install button to get started.

Once the application is installed, you'll be prompted to configure a custom Status list. The app comes preconfigured with popular status options.

_NOTE_

Separate each status option with a comma (eg: phone, email, chat). It's recommended to keep each status option short and clear to help with the user experience. Long status options may get truncated.

When the app is initially installed, all agents will be set to a status of "unknown". This will be updated once agents set their status for the first time.
